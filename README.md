# Whack A Ruby

A variation of the "Whack A Mole!", this game is done all in Ruby following the tutorial from "Learn Game Programming with Ruby" by Mark Sobkowicz.

# What I learned

I learned how to use the Gosu library to do simple functionalities such as display the window for the game, assigning the controls (mouse clicks, spacebar), display font and get objects to move on the screen.

# Future Upgrades
1. Create an option level that will set from Easy - Difficult with a variation of the Ruby gem appearing for a short/long and less/more on the screen.
2. Give the player the option choose a different gem than Ruby.
3. Allow the user to have multiple gems appear on the screen to play.
4. Add something that the user is not suppose to click on that will immediately terminate the game.
